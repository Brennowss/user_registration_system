Purpose

This project was developed as part of a daily study routine to reinforce:

## Functions and return values
- Lists and dictionaries
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- Basic code organization
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Future Improvements
- Data persistence (file or database)
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Automated tests
- Refactoring into additional modules if needed
